# ViPal: A framework for virulence prediction of influenza viruses with prior viral knowledge using genomic sequence

Influenza viruses broadly pose threats to public health and cause economic loss. Previous work has revealed the viral factors that influence the virulence of influenza viruses. However, none of the existing work explicitly takes prior viral knowledge into account. This knowledge is usually represented by categorical and discrete information. How to make full use of the preceding domain knowledge into existing virulence study is challenging but beneficial. This paper proposes a general framework named ViPval for virulence prediction that incorporates discrete prior viral mutation and reassortment information based on all eight influenza segments. The posterior regularization technique is leveraged to transform prior viral knowledge to constraint features and integrated into the machine learning models. Experimental results on influenza genomic datasets validated that our proposed framework can improve virulence prediction performance over baselines. The comparison between ViPval and other existing methods showed comparable performance and computation efficiency. Moreover, the interpretable analysis through SHAP identified the scores of constraint features contributing to the prediction. We hope this framework could provide assistance for the accurate detection of influenza virulence and facilitate flu surveillance.
